# Eventually, this will be an opportunity to validate certificates
# haven't been revoked, etc.  Renewal will only occur if expiration
# is within 30 days.

# plomlompom added the --webroot -w /var/www/html/ so that renewal
# works with nginx running, and the nginx reload post-hook so that
# the new certificates are linked to by nginx. Note that by default
# we rely on the systemd timer service file instead of this cronjob,
# but since both are installed by the certbot package to serve which
# ever of the two is used, we cautiously adapt both of them too.
